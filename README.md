# self-path-learning-bluetooth-car

you can run the car anyway you want

anyways, we used l298n while making the final protype
after driving it the way you want, if after a range it disconnects, then it will return back to you using the same path

this will send the robot to the starting destination again, where it came all the way from, within the same path

you can set the speed with analogWrite(); command where so ever you want
